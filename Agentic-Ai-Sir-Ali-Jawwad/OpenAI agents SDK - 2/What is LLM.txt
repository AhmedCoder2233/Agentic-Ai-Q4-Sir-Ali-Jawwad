A Large Language Model (LLM) is an advanced artificial intelligence system trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. It is capable of performing a wide range of language-related tasks such as answering questions, writing content, translating languages, and summarizing information. LLMs are at the core of modern AI applications and are widely used in chatbots, virtual assistants, and content generation tools.
